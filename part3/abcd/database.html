    <h1>üë©‚ÄçüíªClient & ‚öôÔ∏èServer & üóÉÔ∏èDatabase</h1>
    <ul>
        <p>Imagine a restaurant:</p>
        <li>The client (Browser / App) is a customer ordering food (makes requests e.g. "get all notes").</li>
        <li>The server (Express / Node.js) is the waiter who takes your order and brings your food (handles requests & logic). </li>
        <li>The database (MongoDB via Mongoose) is the kitchen where the food is actually stored and prepared (stores and retrieves data).</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Document Database (Document Store)</h1>
    <p>is data storage system designed for storing, retrieving and managing <span style="color:red">document-oriented information</span>.<br/ >
    Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of <span style="color:red">NoSQL databases</span>.<br />
    Document-oriented databases are inherently a subclass of the <span style="color:red">key-value store</span>, another NoSQL database concept.</p>

    <h1>Collections & Document in MongoDB</h1>
    <p>
        <b>üì¶ Think of it like this:</b> <br />
        If a database is a <span style="color:red">filing cabinet</span>, <br />
        a collection is a <span style="color:red">folder</span> in the cabinet,   <br />
        then a document is a <span style="color:red">file</span> inside the folder.
    </p>
    <h3>Collections</h3>
    <p>It's like <span style="color:red">folders of documents</span>. uments (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.</p>

    <h3>Document</h3>
    <p>MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.</p>

    <h1>MongoDB</h1>
    <p>MongoDB is the database system. <br />
    You still need to install it, run it, and connect it to other parts of your app (like backend, frontend, hosting, etc.) <br />
    So it's like a car engine, not a whole car. Instead, <b>connecting DB, frontend and backend can be a whole car.</b></p>

    <h1>MongoDB Atlas</h1>
    <p>
        <b>üì¶ Think of it like this:</b> <br />
        If mongoDB is like a <span style="color:red">car engine</span> (=core tool for storing data which needs setup), <br />
        then Atlas is like <span style="color:red">Uber</span> letting you use the car without owning it.
    </p>
    <p>MongoDB Atlas is a cloud service that hosts your MongoDB database online. Instead of installing MongoDB on your computer or server, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Atlas to create and manage MongoDB databases in the cloud.</li>
        <li>Connect your app to it from anywhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Mongoose</h1>
    <p>We could use the database directly from our JavaScript code with the official <b>MongoDB Node.js driver</b> library, but it is quite cumbersome to use. We will instead use the <b style="color:red">Mongoose</b> library that offers a higher-level API.</p>
    <p>Mongoose could be described as an <span style="color:red">object document mapper (ODM)</span>, and saving JavaScript objects as Mongo documents is straightforward with this library¬°.</p>

    <h1>üß± Schema</h1>
    <p>A Schema defines the structure of documents within a MongoDB collection. Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.</p>

    <h1>üèóÔ∏è  Model</h1>
    <p>A Model is a wrapper on top of the schema. Models are constructor functions compiled from Schema definitions. An instance of a model is called a document. Models are responsible for creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database. <b>Provides CRUD operations</b>. </p>

    <h1>üìå Summary Table: Schema vs Model vs Collection</h1>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Concept</td>
            <td>Defined In</td>
            <td>Role</td>
            <td>Interacts with DB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Schema</b></td>
            <td>Mongoose</td>
            <td>Defines the structure and rules for documents (data shape, types)</td>
            <td>‚ùå No</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Model</b></td>
            <td>Mongoose</td>
            <td>A JavaScript object created from a schema, used to interact with the database (CRUD operations)</td>
            <td>‚úÖ Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Collection</b></td>
            <td>MongoDB</td>
            <td>The actual storage in the database; stores many documents</td>
            <td>‚úÖ Yes</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h1>üîÑ Mongoose & Express</h1>
    <p><b>
        ‚úÖ Mongoose handles data access (database layer) <br />
        ‚úÖ Express handles routing and HTTP (server layer)</b></p>
    <h3>Data Access (Mongoose) + HTTP Requests (Express)</h3>
    <p>Mongoose does not directly handle HTTP requests like GET, POST, or DELETE in the way Express does. Instead:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mongoose handles data operations: like find(), save(), deleteOne(), etc.</li>
        <li>Express receives the HTTP requests, and inside those route handlers, you call Mongoose functions.</li>

        <ul>
            <p>Express handles routing the request which means deciding what your server should do when it receives a specific HTTP request.</p>
            <p>Think of your web server like a receptionist at an office. When someone walks in and asks for something:</p>
            <li>If they say, ‚ÄúI want a list of notes,‚Äù the receptionist sends them to the "Notes" department.</li>
            <li>If they say, ‚ÄúI want to delete note #5,‚Äù the receptionist forwards them to the "Delete" desk.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
