    <h1>Document Database (Document Store)</h1>
    <p>is data storage system designed for storing, retrieving and managing <span style="color:red">document-oriented information</span>.<br/ >
    Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of <span style="color:red">NoSQL databases</span>.<br />
    Document-oriented databases are inherently a subclass of the <span style="color:red">key-value store</span>, another NoSQL database concept.</p>

    <h1>Collections & Document in MongoDB</h1>
    <p>
        <b>ðŸ“¦ Think of it like this:</b> <br />
        If a database is a <span style="color:red">filing cabinet</span>, <br />
        a collection is a <span style="color:red">folder</span> in the cabinet,   <br />
        then a document is a <span style="color:red">file</span> inside the folder.
    </p>
    <h3>Collections</h3>
    <p>It's like <span style="color:red">folders of documents</span>. uments (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.</p>

    <h3>Document</h3>
    <p>MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.</p>

    <h1>MongoDB</h1>
    <p>MongoDB is the database system. <br />
    You still need to install it, run it, and connect it to other parts of your app (like backend, frontend, hosting, etc.) <br />
    So it's like a car engine, not a whole car. Instead, <b>connecting DB, frontend and backend can be a whole car.</b></p>

    <h1>MongoDB Atlas</h1>
    <p>
        <b>ðŸ“¦ Think of it like this:</b> <br />
        If mongoDB is like a <span style="color:red">car engine</span> (=core tool for storing data which needs setup), <br />
        then Atlas is like <span style="color:red">Uber</span> letting you use the car without owning it.
    </p>
    <p>MongoDB Atlas is a cloud service that hosts your MongoDB database online. Instead of installing MongoDB on your computer or server, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Atlas to create and manage MongoDB databases in the cloud.</li>
        <li>Connect your app to it from anywhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Mongoose</h1>
    <p>We could use the database directly from our JavaScript code with the official <b>MongoDB Node.js driver</b> library, but it is quite cumbersome to use. We will instead use the <b style="color:red">Mongoose</b> library that offers a higher-level API.</p>
    <p>Mongoose could be described as an <span style="color:red">object document mapper (ODM)</span>, and saving JavaScript objects as Mongo documents is straightforward with this libraryÂ¡.</p>

    <h1>Schema</h1>
    <p>Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.</p>

    <h1>Model</h1>
    <p>Models are fancy constructors compiled from Schema definitions. An instance of a model is called a document. Models are responsible for creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database.</p>
