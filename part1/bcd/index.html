    <h2>concat</h2>
    <p>One characteristic of the functional programming paradigm is the use of immutable data structures.</p>
    <p>In React code, it is preferable to use the method concat, which creates a new array with the added item. This ensures the original array remains unchanged.</p>
    <script>
        const t = [1, -1, 3]

        const t2 = t.concat(5)  // creates new array

        console.log(t)  // [1, -1, 3] is printed
        console.log(t2) // [1, -1, 3, 5] is printed
    </script>
    <p>The method call t.concat(5) does not add a new item to the old array but returns a new array which, besides containing the items of the old array, also contains the new item.</p>


    <h2>map</h2>
    <p>map creates a new array, for which the function given as a parameter is used to create the items</p>
    <script>
        const t1 = [1, 2, 3]

        const m1 = t1.map(value => value * 2)
        console.log(m1)   // [2, 4, 6] is printed
    </script>

    <h2>this</h2>
    <p>the value of <i>this</i> in JavaScript is defined based on how the method is being called. When setTimeout is calling the method, it is the JavaScript engine that actually calls the method and, at that point, <i>this</i> refers to the <b>global object</b>.</p>
    <script>
    const arto = {
        name: 'Arto Hellas',
        greet: function() {
            console.log('hello, my name is ' + this.name)
        },
    }

    setTimeout(arto.greet, 1000)</script>

    <p>There are several mechanisms by which the original this can be preserved. One of these is using a method called <b>bind:</b></p>
    <script>
        setTimeout(arto.greet.bind(arto), 1000)
    </script>
    <p>Calling <b>arto.greet.bind(arto)</b> creates a new function where this is bound to point to Arto, independent of where and how the method is being called.</p>

    <h1 style="color: blue">Component state, Event handlers</h1>

    <a href="https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory"><h2>State?</h2></a>
    <p>Components often need to change what is on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of <b>component-specific memory</b> is called <i>state</i>.</p>

    <h2>State Hook</h2>
    <p>The function call adds state to the component and renders it initialized with the value zero. The function returns an array that contains two items. We assign the items to the variables counter and setCounter by using the destructuring assignment syntax shown earlier.
    </p>
    <script>
        const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)
    </script>
    <p>The counter variable is assigned the initial value of state, which is zero. The variable setCounter is assigned a function that will be used to modify the state.</p>

    <p>When the state modifying function <i>setCounter</i> is called, React re-renders the component which means that the function body of the component function gets re-executed</p>

    <h2>Event handling</h2>
    <p>🔄 All event handlers, i.e. <code>onClick={() => ...}</code>, are callback functions, but not all callback functions, i.e. <code>() => setCounter(counter + 1)</code>, are event handlers.</p>
    <p>We define the event handlers for our buttons where we declare their onClick attributes: <span style="color: red">The setCounter function is called (that's why it is called callback function) <b>only when a user clicks the button</b>.</span>
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;button onClick={<span style="color: red">() =&gt;setCounter(counter + 1)</span>}&gt; plus&lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Not ussing this way! it will make  infinite loop. <br /> Because, in this case, You're not passing a function; <span style="color:red">you're passing the result of calling</span> <code>setCounter(...).</code> </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;button onClick={<span style="color: red">setCounter(counter + 1)</span>}&gt;plus&lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>But usually defining event handlers within JSX-templates is not a good idea. And defining event handlers directly in the attribute of the button is not necessarily the best possible idea.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;button onClick={<span style="color: red">() =&gt; setValue(0)</span>}&gt;button&lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <pre>
        <code>
            const App = () =&gt; {
            const [value, setValue] = useState(10)

            <span style="color: red">
            const handleClick = () =&gt; console.log(&#39;clicked the button&#39;)
            </span>
            return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                {value}
                &lt;button onClick={<span style="color: red">handleClick</span>}&gt;button&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                )
            }
        </code>

        <p>The handleClick variable is now assigned to a reference to the function. The reference is passed to the button as the onClick attribute:</p>

        <code>
            &lt;button onClick={<span style="color: red">handleClick</span>}&gt;button&lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>But a function that returns a function can...</h3>

    <pre>
        <code>
            const App = () =&gt; {
            const [value, setValue] = useState(10)

            const hello = () =&gt; {
                <span style="color: red">const handler = () =&gt; console.log(&#39;hello world&#39;)
                return handler</span>
            }

            return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                {value}
                &lt;button onClick={<span style="color: red">hello()</span>}&gt;button&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                )
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>The event handler is now set to a function call: Earlier on we stated that an event handler may not be a call to a function and that it has to be a function or a reference to a function. Why then does a function call work in this case?</p>

    <p>When the component is rendered, the following function gets executed:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            const hello = () =&gt; {
                const handler = () =&gt; console.log(&#39;hello world&#39;)

                return handler
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>The return value of the function is another function that is assigned to the handler variable: </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;button onClick={hello()}&gt;button&lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>It assigns the return value of hello() to the onClick attribute. Essentially the line gets transformed into:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; console.log(&#39;hello world&#39;)}&gt;
                button
            &lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Spread syntax (...)</h2>
    <p><b>object spread syntax</b> <code>{ ...clicks }</code> creates a new object that has copies of all of the properties of the clicks object. When we specify a particular property - e.g. right in <code>{ ...clicks, right: 1 }</code>, the value of the right property in the new object will be 1.</p>

    <p><span style="color:red">Technically you are returning a new copy of the state every time you run <code>setState</code>.</span> But do note that the ... syntax is doing shallow copy, not deep copy, and deep copy is usually not required.</p>

    <p style="color:blue">The piece of state stored in <code>allClicks</code> is now set to be an array that contains all of the items of <span style="color: red">the previous state array</span> plus the letter L. <span style="color:black">Adding the new item to the array is accomplished with the concat method,</span> which does not mutate the existing array but rather <span style="color: red"> returns a new copy of the array</span> with the item added to it.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            const [<span style="color:blue">allClicks</span>, setAll] = useState([]);

            const handleLeftClick = () =&gt; {
                <span style="color:blue">setAll(allClicks.concat(&#39;L&#39;))</span>
                setLeft(left + 1)
            }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The application below appears to work. However, <b>it is forbidden in React to mutate state directly</b>, since it can result in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37755997/why-cant-i-directly-modify-a-components-state-really/40309023#40309023">unexpected side effects</a>. Changing state has to always be done by setting the state to a new object. If properties from the previous state object are not changed, they need to simply be copied, which is done by copying those properties into a new object and setting that as the new state.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            const handleLeftClick = () =&gt; {
                <span style="color:red">clicks.left++</span>
                setClicks(clicks)
            }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Storing all of the state in a single state object is a bad choice for this particular application; there's no apparent benefit and the resulting application is a lot more complex.</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            const [ clicks, setClicks ] = useState({left: 0, right: 0})
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>So, instead, storing the click counters into separate pieces of state is a far more suitable choice.</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            const [left, setLeftClick] = useState(0);
            const [right, setRightClick] = useState(0);
        </code>
    </pre>
