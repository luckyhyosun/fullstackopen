    <i><h2>We must also develop a sufficient understanding of the principles of both the <span style="color:red">JavaScript runtime</span> and <span style="color:red">React components</span>. Guessing won't be enough.</h2></i>

    <h1>Java Script</h1>

    <h3>JavaScript engines</h3>
    <p>So called, runtime environments, follow the <span style="color:red">asynchronous model</span>. This means that code execution continues immediately after calling an IO function, without waiting for it to return.</p>

    <p>When an asynchronous operation is completed, or, more specifically, at some point after its completion, the JavaScript engine calls the event handlers registered to the operation.</p>

    <p>Currently, JavaScript engines are <span style="color:red">single-threaded</span>, which means that they cannot execute code in parallel. As a result, it is a requirement in practice to use a <span style="color:red">non-blocking model</span> for executing IO operations.</p>

    <h3>axios library</h3>
    <p>This is library for communication between the browser and server. It functions like <code>fetch</code> but is somewhat more pleasant to use. Another good reason to use axios is our getting familiar with adding external libraries, so-called <i>npm packages</i>, to React projects.</p>

    <p><b>NB:</b> npm-commands should always be <span style="color:red">run in the project root directory</span>, which is where the <span style="color:red">package.json</span> file can be found.</p>

    <p> Install json-server as a <span style="color:blue">development dependency (only used during development)</span>, which means it is used for assistance during software development, by executing the command:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            npm install json-server <span style="color:blue">--save-dev</span>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We can now conveniently, without parameter definitions, start the json-server from the project root directory with the command:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            by adding this line in the <span style="color:blue">package.json</span> file:

            {
                // ...
                "scripts": {
                    "dev": "vite",
                    "build": "vite build",
                    "lint": "eslint .",
                    "preview": "vite preview",
                    <span style="color:blue">"server": "json-server -p 3001 db.json"</span>
                },
            }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>And the run this code to the terminal: </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            npm run server
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p><b>axio</b> is installed as <span style="color:red">a runtime dependency</span> of the application because the execution of the program requires the existence of the library. </p>

    <h1>Promise üëå</h1>
    <p>A Promise is <span style="color:red">an object</span> representing the <span style="color:red">eventual completion or failure</span> of an asynchronous operation.</p>

    <p>In other words, a promise is an object that represents an asynchronous operation. A promise can have three distinct states:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The promise is <i><span style="color:red">pending</span></i>: It means that the asynchronous operation corresponding to the promise has not yet finished and the final value is not available yet.</li>
        <li>The promise is <i><span style="color:red">fulfilled</span></i>: It means that the operation has been completed and the final value is available, which generally is a successful operation.</li>
        <li>The promise is <i><span style="color:red">rejected</span></i>: It means that an error prevented the final value from being determined, which generally represents a failed operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Then ü§û</h1>
    <p>If, and when, we want to access the <span style="color:red">result of the operation represented by the <b>promise</b></span>, we must register <b>an event handler</b> to the promise. This is achieved using the method <span style="color:red">then</span>:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            const promise = axios.get(&#39;http://localhost:3001/notes&#39;)

            promise.<span style="color:red">then</span>(response =&gt; {
                console.log(response)
            })
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h1>Response</h1>
    <p>The JavaScript runtime environment calls the callback function registered by the then method providing it with <span style="color:red">a response object</span> as a parameter. The response object contains all the essential data related to <span style="color:red">the response of an HTTP GET request</span>, which would include the returned data, status code, and headers.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            axios
                <span style="color:red">.get</span>(&#39;http://localhost:3001/notes&#39;)
                <span style="color:red">.then</span>(response =&gt; {
                    const notes = response.data
                    console.log(notes)
                })
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p><b>NB:</b> The data returned by the server is plain text, basically just one long string. The axios library is still able to parse the data into a JavaScript array.</p>

    <h1>REST</h1>
    <p>In REST terminology, we refer to individual data objects, such as the notes in our application, as <i>resources</i>.</p>

    <h3>Data format</h3>
    <p>json-server requires all data to be sent in JSON format. What this means in practice is that <span style="color:red">the data must be a correctly formatted string</span> and that the request must contain the Content-Type request header with the value application/json</p>

    <h1>Origin</h1>
    <p>‚ÄúOrigin‚Äù does not mean the same root file or folder. It refers to three specific parts of a URL:</p>
    <p>üîê The <span style="color:red">‚Äúorigin‚Äù</span> = <b>scheme (protocol) + domain (host) + port</b></p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>URL</th>
            <th>Scheme (protocol)</th>
            <th>domain (host)</th>
            <th>port</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>https://example.com</td>
            <td>https</td>
            <td>example.com</td>
            <td>443</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>http://example.com</td>
            <td>https</td>
            <td>example.com</td>
            <td>80</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>http://api.example.com</td>
            <td>https</td>
            <td>api.example.com</td>
            <td>80</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>‚úÖ Same origin example:</p>
    <p>
        Main page: <code><span style="color:red">https://example.com/</span>index.html</code> <br />
        Resource: <code><span style="color:red">https://example.com/</span>style.css</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Both use:
        <ul>
            <li>The same protocol: <span style="background-color:lightgrey">https</span></li>
            <li>The same domain: <span style="background-color:lightgrey">example.com</span></li>
            <li>The same port (default <span style="background-color:lightgrey">443</span> for https)</li>
        </ul>
        ‚úÖ So this is a same-origin request.
    </p>

    <p>‚ùå Different origin examples:</p>
    <p>
        Main page: <code><span style="color:red">https:</span></code>//example.com <br />
        Resource: <code><span style="color:red">http:</span></code>//example.com/script.js
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not same-origin because:
        <ul>
            <li>Protocols are different: <span style="background-color:lightgrey">https</span> vs <span style="background-color:lightgrey">http</span></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>‚ùå Different origin examples:</p>
    <p>
        Main page: http://<code><span style="color:red">example.com</span></code> <br />
        Resource: http://<code><span style="color:red">api.example.com/</span></code>data.js
    </p>
    <p>
        Different domain (example.com vs api.example.com) ‚Üí ‚ùå different origin
    </p>

    <h1>CORS</h1>
    <p>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system created by W3C (the web standards group) that lets servers say: <br />
        <pre>
            Yes, it's okay for that other site to load this resource.
        </pre>
    By setting proper CORS headers, a server can safely allow cross-origin (a request is made from one website to a different origin) requests.
    </p>

    <h3>Why CORS matters?</h3>
    <p>Browsers block cross-origin requests by default when they try to read sensitive responses (like API data). If you want to allow it, the server must set special headers ‚Äî this is called CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).</p>

    <h1>cors Middleware</h1>
    <p>We can allow requests from other origins by using Node's <b>cors</b> middleware.</p>
