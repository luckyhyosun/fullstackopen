    <i><h2>We must also develop a sufficient understanding of the principles of both the <span style="color:red">JavaScript runtime</span> and <span style="color:red">React components</span>. Guessing won't be enough.</h2></i>

    <h1>Java Script</h1>

    <h3>JavaScript engines</h3>
    <p>So called, runtime environments, follow the <span style="color:red">asynchronous model</span>. This means that code execution continues immediately after calling an IO function, without waiting for it to return.</p>

    <p>When an asynchronous operation is completed, or, more specifically, at some point after its completion, the JavaScript engine calls the event handlers registered to the operation.</p>

    <p>Currently, JavaScript engines are <span style="color:red">single-threaded</span>, which means that they cannot execute code in parallel. As a result, it is a requirement in practice to use a <span style="color:red">non-blocking model</span> for executing IO operations.</p>

    <h3>axios library</h3>
    <p>This is library for communication between the browser and server. It functions like <code>fetch</code> but is somewhat more pleasant to use. Another good reason to use axios is our getting familiar with adding external libraries, so-called <i>npm packages</i>, to React projects.</p>

    <p><b>NB:</b> npm-commands should always be <span style="color:red">run in the project root directory</span>, which is where the <span style="color:red">package.json</span> file can be found.</p>

    <p> Install json-server as a <span style="color:blue">development dependency (only used during development)</span>, which means it is used for assistance during software development, by executing the command:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            npm install json-server <span style="color:blue">--save-dev</span>
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>We can now conveniently, without parameter definitions, start the json-server from the project root directory with the command:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            by adding this line in the <span style="color:blue">package.json</span> file:

            {
                // ...
                "scripts": {
                    "dev": "vite",
                    "build": "vite build",
                    "lint": "eslint .",
                    "preview": "vite preview",
                    <span style="color:blue">"server": "json-server -p 3001 db.json"</span>
                },
            }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>And the run this code to the terminal: </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            npm run server
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p><b>axio</b> is installed as <span style="color:red">a runtime dependency</span> of the application because the execution of the program requires the existence of the library. </p>

    <h1>Promise 👌</h1>
    <p>A Promise is <span style="color:red">an object</span> representing the <span style="color:red">eventual completion or failure</span> of an asynchronous operation.</p>

    <p>In other words, a promise is an object that represents an asynchronous operation. A promise can have three distinct states:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The promise is <i><span style="color:red">pending</span></i>: It means that the asynchronous operation corresponding to the promise has not yet finished and the final value is not available yet.</li>
        <li>The promise is <i><span style="color:red">fulfilled</span></i>: It means that the operation has been completed and the final value is available, which generally is a successful operation.</li>
        <li>The promise is <i><span style="color:red">rejected</span></i>: It means that an error prevented the final value from being determined, which generally represents a failed operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Then 🤞</h1>
    <p>If, and when, we want to access the <span style="color:red">result of the operation represented by the <b>promise</b></span>, we must register <b>an event handler</b> to the promise. This is achieved using the method <span style="color:red">then</span>:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            const promise = axios.get(&#39;http://localhost:3001/notes&#39;)

            promise.<span style="color:red">then</span>(response =&gt; {
                console.log(response)
            })
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h1>Response</h1>
    <p>The JavaScript runtime environment calls the callback function registered by the then method providing it with <span style="color:red">a response object</span> as a parameter. The response object contains all the essential data related to <span style="color:red">the response of an HTTP GET request</span>, which would include the returned data, status code, and headers.</p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            axios
                <span style="color:red">.get</span>(&#39;http://localhost:3001/notes&#39;)
                <span style="color:red">.then</span>(response =&gt; {
                    const notes = response.data
                    console.log(notes)
                })
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p><b>NB:</b> The data returned by the server is plain text, basically just one long string. The axios library is still able to parse the data into a JavaScript array.</p>

    <h1>REST</h1>
    <p>In REST terminology, we refer to individual data objects, such as the notes in our application, as <i>resources</i>.</p>

    <h3>Data format</h3>
    <p>json-server requires all data to be sent in JSON format. What this means in practice is that <span style="color:red">the data must be a correctly formatted string</span> and that the request must contain the Content-Type request header with the value application/json</p>
