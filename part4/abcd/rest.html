<h1>RESTful HTTP API</h1>
<p><span style="color:red">Representational State Transfer</span>, aka <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">REST</a>, is an architectural style meant for building scalable web applications</p>
<p>REST APIs are interfaces that are intended for programmatic use, and the error status code is all that is needed.</p>

<h2>Terms</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Resource(s)</li>
    <p>are singular things, like <i>notes</i> in the case of our application, are called <i>resources</i> in RESTful thinking. Every resource has an associated URL which is the resource's unique address.</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            let notes = [
                {
                    id: &quot;1&quot;,
                    content: &quot;HTML is easy&quot;,
                    important: true
                },
                {
                    id: &quot;2&quot;,
                    content: &quot;Browser can execute only JavaScript&quot;,
                    important: false
                },
                {
                    id: &quot;3&quot;,
                    content: &quot;GET and POST are the most important methods of HTTP protocol&quot;,
                    important: true
                }
            ]
        </code>
    </pre>

    <li>Identifier</li>
    <p>is like an <i>id</i>, which is creating unique addresses is to combine the name of the resource type with the resource's unique identifier.<br />
    <pre>
        <i>www.example.com/api/notes/</i> means find all notes.<br/>
        <i>www.example.com/api/notes<span style="color:red">/10</span></i> means find a single note with the id 10.
    </pre></p>

    <p>We can define parameters for routes in Express by using the colon syntax:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            app.get(&#39;/api/notes/<span style="color:red">:id</span>&#39;, (request, response) =&gt; {
                const id = request.params.id
                const note = notes.find(note =&gt; note.id === id)
                response.json(note)
            })
        </code>
    </pre>

    <li>Get/ Post/ Delete/ Put/ Patch Request </li>
    <p>is how we manage to roughly define what REST refers to as a <span style="color:red">uniform interface</span>, which means a consistent way of defining interfaces that makes it possible for systems to cooperate.</p>

    <li>Routing</li>
    <p>refers to how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.</p>
</ul>

<h1>Spread Syntax</h1>
<p>used in two completely different contexts with different purposes.</p>

<h2>üî¢  1. Spread in <code>Math.max(...[1, 2, 3])</code></h2>
<p>üìå Used to <span style="color:red">unpack array elements</span> as arguments to a function. This spreads the elements of an array into individual values:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        Math.max(<span style="color:red">...numbers</span>); <span style="color:grey">// same as Math.max(1, 2, 3)</span>
    </code>
</pre>

<h2>üß† 2. Spread in React state: {...state}</h2>
<p>üìå Used to make <span style="color:red">immutable updates</span> ‚Äî you're creating a new object instead of mutating the original. In React, we use spread syntax to copy an object or array, often in useState updates:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: &#39;Anna&#39;, age: 20 });

        setUser(prev =&gt; ({
        <span style="color:red">...prev</span>,
        age: 21
        }));
    </code>
</pre>

<h2>üí° Helpful Tip</h2>
<p>You can think of ... like a <span style="color:red">copy-unpack tool</span>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>In function calls</b>: it unpacks values from an array.</li>
    <li><b>In object/array literals</b>: it copies values into a new structure.</li>
</ul>

<h1>‚öôÔ∏è Development Mode vs üöÄ Production Build</h1>
<p>Vite (French for ‚Äúfast‚Äù) is a build tool and development server. <b>It used for both development mode and production build ‚Äî it handles both parts of the frontend development workflow.</b> <br />
Use <code><span style="color:red">vite dev</span></code> to build your app while developing and Use <code><span style="color:red">vite build</span></code> to prepare it for users.</p>

<h3>Development Mode</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Purpose: For writing, debugging, and testing during the development process.</li>
    <li>Feature:
        <ul>
            <li>Unminified code (easier to read and debug).</li>
            <li>Run with <code><span style="color:red">npm run dev</span></code> or <code><span style="color:red">vite</span></code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Production Build</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Purpose: For deployment to end users (live websites, published apps, etc.).</li>
    <li>Feature:
        <ul>
            <li>Optimized and minified code to reduce size and load time.</li>
            <li>Outputs static files in a <b>dist/</b> or <b>build/</b> folder, optimized and ready to host.</li>
            <li>Run with <code><span style="color:red">npm run build</span></code></li>
            <li>When it is time to deploy your app for production, simply run the <code><span style="color:red">vite build</span></code> command.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h1>Proxy</h1>

<h3>üßí Imagine This:</h3>
<p>You (frontend) want to ask the teacher (backend server) a question.<br />
But you're shy üòÖ, so you ask your friend (proxy) to deliver the question for you.<br />
Your friend gives the question to the teacher, gets the answer, and brings it back to you.<br />
That friend is the proxy ‚Äî helping two sides communicate.</p>

<h3>üíª In Web Development</h3>
<p>When you're developing a React frontend on localhost:3000, and your backend is on localhost:3001, <br />
they are technically different servers, so the browser may block requests because of security rules (CORS). <br />
To fix this, you can add a proxy setting in your frontend.</p>

<h3>‚úÖ Why Use a Proxy?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bypasses CORS issues during development.</li>
    <li>Allows you to use short URLs like <code>/api/notes</code> instead of full ones</li>
    <li>Makes frontend and backend talk smoothly during development</li>
</ul>
