## my Q&A

**üê• Why do I need to convert data into JSON to send it back to client?**

üêì You don‚Äôt have to use JSON, but JSON has become the standard format for communication between servers and clients (especially in web APIs).
+ 1. Clients need a structured, universal format
  - Raw JavaScript objects (<code>{ title: "Hello" }</code>) only exist inside your server‚Äôs memory.
  - When data leaves your server, it‚Äôs just text (or bytes) traveling over HTTP.
  - JSON provides a language-agnostic way of representing that data. (React app, an iPhone app-Swift, an Android app-Kotlin, or even Python)
+ 2. HTTP requires strings, not raw objects
  - HTTP transmits text or binary data.
  - JSON is just a string representation of the object:
  ``` js
  { title: "Hello" } ‚Üí '{"title":"Hello"}'
  ```
+ 3. Automatic parsing on the client side
  - Browsers, <code>fetch()</code>, <code>axios</code>, mobile SDKs ‚Äî all expect JSON from an API.
  - In JavaScript, you can instantly parse JSON:
  ``` js
    const response = await fetch("/api/blogs");
    const data = await response.json();

    // usable JavaScript object/array
    console.log(data);
  ```
+ 4. Standards and interoperability
  - JSON is lightweight, human-readable, and widely supported.
  - It replaced older formats like XML because it‚Äôs simpler and faster.
  - By sending JSON, you ensure any client can work with your API.

**üê• Why do I use different ports in Development server?**

üêì Because Backend and Frontend are different processes in Development server, unlike Production Server.

Production Server(Express, Djanog...etc): Backend logic lives. And backend and frontend served together at one port.

Development Server(React, Vite, Next,js...etc): Frontend codes lives. Here, backend and frontend are different two processes. So running them separately makes development faster and easier.
To handle requests from different ports (from back/frontend) we can use **CORS / Proxy**.

## Appendix
**Port** is a communication endpoint and listens for requests.

**Async**  declare a function as asynchronous which will require time to complete that JavaScript may have to wait for. And it returns a Promise.

**Await** is an operator and is possible only inside of an async function. And it waits for a Promise.

**Response.json()**
<code>Response</code> is an object provided by Express to send data back to the clien. And <code>.json()</code> is a method that
+ Converts the JavaScript object/array (blogs in this case) into a JSON string.
+ Sets the correct HTTP header: <code>Content-Type: application/json</code>.
+ Sends the JSON as the HTTP response body
